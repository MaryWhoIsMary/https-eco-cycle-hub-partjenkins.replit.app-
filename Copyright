# Global Code Protection Policy

This policy applies to all my repos and apps in this account.

- I own this code unless a repo says otherwise.
- You can look and learn, but you can’t sell or repost it without my permission.
- If you contribute, you keep credit for your work, but I keep control of the project.
- Don’t add bad or harmful code.
- Everything is “as is” with no promises.
